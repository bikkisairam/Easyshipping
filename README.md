Built a Chrome extension that automates shipping form entry for Amazon, eBay, and Pirate Ship, pulling real-time weight from a USB scale and auto-filling package dimensions.

Integrated a Flask server to read live weight via HID/serial interface from DYMO/Accuteck scales and serve it through a local API.

Engineered intelligent DOM automation to simulate user input, trigger hidden modals (e.g. Amazon’s “Change parcel dimensions”), and ensure compatibility across multiple sites.

Designed a transparent, vertical floating widget for box size selection, improving usability without interrupting workflow.

Reduced manual entry time and labeling errors, helping cut average shipping cost by 20% through improved dimensional accuracy and rate selection.
